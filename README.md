# About
This repository is part of an exercise to learn Java. The project reads in "planetary quadrants" from `.txt` files, parses data from file content and name and stores this data in an SQLite database.

A "quadrant" looks something like this:
```
xxxxxxxzzzxxx
xxxxxxxzzzxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxuu
xxggxxxzzzxxx
xxgggxxzxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Letters indicate different resources that need to be charted and evaluated.
